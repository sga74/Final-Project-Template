## Project Title

Sofia Almeida  
OCEAN 215 Final Project  
Autumn 2024  

This project analyzed the rates of Sea level rise in three different coastal locations in California over a 25 year period from 1992 to 2017. I hypothesized that Humboldt bay would exhibit the highest rate of sea level rise due to the sinking vertical land motion beneath this region of California. This hypothesis was not supported as sea level rise rates appeared very similar across all locations with La Jolla showing a slightly higher rate. Additional issues with La Jolla data raise questions about the validity of these findings and highlight potential areas of expansion in future analysis.
